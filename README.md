# pands-weekly-tasks
This repository contains the weekly tasks that were completed as part of the Programming and Scripting classes in ATU with the lecturer Andrew Beatty.
These tasks display several Python scripts that were created to demonstrate the skills that were developed during the course.
This README has been written with [Github's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
MarkDown was used in this README file and was based on [in GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Get Started 

To understand better the tasks have a look at the section About These Tasks below and start by reading through each one of the Weekly Tasks in numerical order. Once you have a glimse of what the task is about then you can either go to a specific program to undestand the steps adopted to build up the script by reading through the comments provided or you can run the program in a Python interpreter and have fun by testing them out.

## About These Tasks

There were 8 tasks that were completed throught the Programming and Scripting course and the details of each task is described under the headings below.


### Weekly Tasks 1: helloworld.py


### Weekly Tasks 2: bank.py


### Weekly Tasks 3: accounts.py


### Weekly Tasks 4: collatz.py


###  Weekly Tasks 5: weekday.py


### Weekly Tasks 6: squareroot.py


### Weekly Tasks 7: es.py and moby-dick.txt


### Weekly Tasks 8: plottask.py


## Use of these tasks

This repository pands-weekly-tasks will be used to grade my learning from the Programming and Scripting course.
This repository can be used by other users as a source of examples of codes that can be written by a new Python user.
Also, these tasks reflect my understanding from the Python programming skills learned during the course, which is far from perfect but show a perspective of a student who has started learning Python.


## Get Help

If questions are raised when reviewing these tasks you can contact me via github and I will be happy to provide more information.

## Contribute

This is a one-off repository completed with the goal of attending the assignment requirements for the course of Programming and Scripting in ATU and the contribution will be based on feedback provided by Andrew Beatty during the lectures and during the grading of this Assignment. 
Any other activity has been entirely completed by the author.
